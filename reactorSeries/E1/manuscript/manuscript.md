## Scene one

Hi everyone. 
My name is doudou. 
I am a nuclear enginneer. 

## Scene two

When people talk about nuclear energy, there is always a bliss of anxiety going around: non human-readable equations, harmful radiation, atomic bombs, Chernobyl, Fukushima, or even big cooling towers releasing unharmful steam into the atmosphere. 

## Scene three

There seems to exist a thick layer of ice between most people and nuclear energy causing some misunderstandings. 
What is nuclear energy? Is nuclear power plant safe?
In this series of videos, I am gonna explained some common facts about nuclear power plant, well, in a simple way. 

## Scene four

(convert from a graph to a animation?)

Over the years the nuclear energy industries experience different situations in different countries. Like Germany, Swissland have decided to phase out nuclear energy while countries like China, south Korea, England are still involved in building new reactors. 

## Scene five
What are nuclear reactors?

## Scene six
No doubt that a nuclear power plant is a sophisticated system. 
It combines the efforts of hunderds of experts, physists & mechanical engineers & electrical engineers & chemists to run a single unit. 

## Scene seven
But put it in the easiest way, a nuclear power plant is like nothing but heating/boiling coolant medium in one or several closed systems. 

## Scene eight

Take light water reactor for example, the coolant, aka. water, absorbs heat from nuclear fuel and then releases it through driving a big turbine which is connected to the generator producing electricity. 
Except for the nuclear fuel part, the coal power plant works with the same mechanism. 
But nuclear power plant is just cleaner, in the sense of CO2 and SO2 emission.

## Scene nine

Since 1950s, various types of reactors have been built, deployed or designed.

Depending on the reaction type, there are fission reactors utilizing the energy by splitting heavy atoms into lighter ones. There are also fusion reactors in which extremes light atoms are 

If we try to group them by purposes, there are commercial reactors for electricity production, research reactors conducting different researches, propulsion reactors offering driving force for like space ships and submarines. 

If we try to group them by the coolant medium, we will see light water, heavy water, gas, sodium, lead-bismuth, molten salt, etc.
You can find reactors which need moderator like water/graphite and reactors which don't need that.

Of course we can also distinguish them with respect to different fuel shape: cylindric pellet, plate, ball or even in a fluid form flowing around thus without any shape.

## Scene ten

Let's take a deeper look at one specific reactor type. Among all the current operating nuclear reactors the biggest share is the so-called pressurized water reactor, aka. PWR. Think the PWR as a simple 2-loop power transmission system, or some strange two-chain bicycle. You are playing as the nuclear fuel cycling the pedales. The first chain is driven through the first gear and going forwards. Then the second chain get the toque from the second gear and moves the wheel to rotate. Hmmm, there is something that I missed, the big cooling tower! Well it's more like a cooling system for the second chain since the wheel can only take around one third of the energy from the chain and it needs to be cooled down all the time to remain under working condition. 

There is another type of nuclear reactor running with light water which is called boiling water reactor, aka. BWR. The BWRs are more like a normal bycycle, with only one chain of course. This type of reactor is more like the coal

As I mentioned before, the current efficiency of a PWR is around 33%, which means only around 33% of the energy generated in the nuclear fuel is converted to electricity. Where does the other 66% go? You may already have the answer, yes, most of them will be emitted through the cooling tower, in a form of giant white water cloud.
