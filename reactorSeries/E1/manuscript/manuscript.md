## Scene one

Hi everyone. 
My name is doudou. 
I am a nuclear enginneer. 

## Scene two

When people talk about nuclear energy, there is always a bliss of anxiety going around: non human-readable equations, harmful radiation, atomic bombs, Chernobyl, Fukushima, or even big cooling towers releasing unharmful steam into the atmosphere. 

## Scene three

There seems to exist a thick layer of ice between most people and nuclear energy causing some misunderstandings. What is nuclear energy? Is nuclear power plant safe? In this series of videos, I am gonna explained some common facts about nuclear power plant, well, in a simple way. 

## Scene four

A nuclear power plant is a sophisticated system, no one can doubt that. But put it in the easiest way, a nuclear power plant is like nothing but heating coolant medium in one or several closed systems. Take light water reactor for example, the coolant, aka. water, absorbs heat from nuclear fuel and then releases it through driving a big turbine which is connected to the generator producing electricity. The coal power plant has the same princiExcept for the nuclear fuel part, the principle of producing electricity in the NPP is quite similar to the coal power plant, but just cleaner, in the sense of CO2 and SO2 emission.

## Scene five

Since 50s last century, various
