1. [Scene one](#Scene-one)
2. [Scene two](#Scene-two)

5. [Scene five](#Scene-five)

## Scene one

Hi everyone. 
My name is doudou. 
I am a nuclear enginneer. 

## Scene two

When people talk about nuclear energy, there is always a bliss of anxiety going around: non human-readable equations, harmful radiation, atomic bombs, Chernobyl, Fukushima, or even big cooling towers releasing unharmful steam into the atmosphere. 

## Scene three

There seems to exist a thick layer of ice between most people and nuclear energy causing some misunderstandings. 
What is nuclear energy? Is nuclear power plant safe?
In this series of videos, I am gonna explained some common facts about nuclear power plant, well, in a simple way. 

## Scene four

(convert from a graph to a animation?)

Over the years the nuclear energy industries experience different situations in different contries. Like Germany, Swissland have decided to phase out nuclear energy while contries like China, south Korea, England are still involved in building new reactors. 

## Scene five
What are nuclear reactors?

## Scene six
No doubt that a nuclear power plant is a sophisticated system. 
It combines the efforts of hunderds of experts, physists & mechanical engineers & electrical engineers & chemists to run a single unit. 

## Scene seven
But put it in the easiest way, a nuclear power plant is like nothing but heating coolant medium in one or several closed systems. 

## Scene eight

Take light water reactor for example, the coolant, aka. water, absorbs heat from nuclear fuel and then releases it through driving a big turbine which is connected to the generator producing electricity. 
Except for the nuclear fuel part, the coal power plant works with the same mechanism. 
But nuclear power plant is just cleaner, in the sense of CO2 and SO2 emission.

## Scene nine

Since 1950s, various types of reactors have been built, deployed or designed.

If we try to group them by purposes, there are commercial reactors for electricity production, research reactors conducting different researches, propulsion reactors offering driving force for like space ships and submarines. 

If we try to group them by the coolant medium, we will see light water, heavy water, gas, sodium, lead-bismuth, molten salt, etc.
You can find reactors which need moderator like water/graphite and reactors which don't need that.

Of course we can also distinguish them with respect to different fuel shape: cylindric pellet, plate, ball or even in a fluid form flowing around thus without any shape.

## Scene ten

Among all the current operating nuclear reactors the so-called pressurized water reactor takes the biggest share.
